					<h2>About Me</h2>
				</header>
				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp From a young age, I've always been passionate about education and effective
					communication. My career
					path has shifted
					over the years, evolving from aspiring teacher to dedicated software engineer. But at the core, my
					values have remained
					the same: I'm all about enriching, educating, and connecting.
				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp Before I dove into the exciting world of tech at Atlas School, I spent more than a
					decade in
					various customer
					service roles. That experience fine-tuned some essential soft skills like leadership, adaptability,
					time management,
					and, perhaps most importantly, empathy. And now, I'm bringing those skills to the tech space.
				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp I'm a self-motivated, detail-oriented individual with a strong commitment to lifelong
					learning. I'm
					seeking a position
					where I can apply my skills and continue to grow as a developer.
				</p>
				</p>
				</p>
				<p>
					&nbsp &nbsp When I'm not coding, you can find me sewing, on my pottery wheel, enjoying live music or
					spending
					time with my family and friends.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Volunteer:</strong> I connect with high school students, sharing my Atlas web development
					journey, promoting creativity, and
					highlighting the value of hands-on technology education.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Activities and Societies:</strong> Head Chair and Founding member of the Student Life
					Committee at Atlas.
				</p>
				<p>
					Feel free to reach out to me via email or LinkedIn. I look forward to hearing from you!

								<strong>Duration: 2 Weeks</strong>
								<br>
								<br>

								&nbsp &nbsp In a creative collaboration, my partner and I set out to develop a web
								application inspired by the serene landscapes of
								Bob Ross, but with a twist—integrating the infinite possibilities of space into each art
								piece. This project not only
								showcases digital art but also offers a unique interactive experience for users to
								explore and engage with the gallery.
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>Project Highlights:</strong>
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>User Gateway:</strong> Crafted a secure login system, ensuring a safe and
								personalized experience for every visitor.
								<br>
								<strong>Art Database:</strong> Managed a comprehensive collection of artwork using
								PostgreSQL and
								Firebase, allowing for efficient data
								retrieval and storage.
								<br>
								<strong>Connective API:</strong> Built with Node.js and Express, this API is the
								linchpin that seamlessly
								links the backend storage to
								the frontend display.
								<br>
								<strong>Interactive Frontend:</strong> Designed with React, our gallery invites users to
								immerse
								themselves in a visually rich and
								responsive environment.
								<br>
								<strong>Efficient Browsing:</strong> Implemented pagination and caching strategies to
								optimize the user
								experience, ensuring smooth and
								swift navigation through the gallery.
								<br>
								<strong>Technologies Utilized:</strong> React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Firebase.
								Project
								coordination and teamwork were facilitated
								using Notion and Slack.
								<br>
								<br>

								&nbsp &nbsp This project was a true partnership, combining our skills in coding, design,
								and project management to create an
								application that is as engaging as it is innovative. By blending the calmness of Bob
								Ross's painting style with the
								theme of space, we aimed to offer a new way for users to connect with art digitally.

								<strong>Duration: 2 Weeks</strong>
								<br>
								<br>
								&nbsp &nbsp In an imaginative leap forward, I undertook a project designed to reimagine
								the digital interface for my school,
								transitioning from Holberton to its new identity as Atlas. This theoretical project was
								split into two phases, focusing
								on mastering Webpack for a React-based application and diving deep into the essentials
								of React development. Above is a
								snapshot of my journey
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Phase 1: Webpack Configuration & Optimization</strong>
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>Modular Mastery:</strong> Designed a modular Webpack setup tailored for a React-based application, streamlining the build process and setting a
								robust foundation.
								<br>

								<strong>Performance Tuning:</strong> Leveraged advanced Webpack features like code splitting, image optimization, and minification to enhance the
								application's production efficiency.
								<br>
								<strong>Development Dynamics:</strong> Established a Webpack development server complete with hot reloading, significantly improving the development workflow.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
								<br>
								Webpack, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, npm.

								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Phase 2: React Intro Project</strong>
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>React Essentials:</strong> Developed a simple yet impactful JavaScript application using React, diving deep into JSX, components, and essential
								debugging tools.
								<br>

								<strong>Component Craftsmanship:</strong> Focused on building reusable components and adeptly managing state to foster a seamless user experience.
								<br>
								<strong>Quality Assurance:</strong> Utilized Enzyme for meticulous component testing, ensuring the application's robust functionality and reliability.
								<br>
								<br>
								<strong>Technologies Used:</strong>
								<br>
								React, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Create-React-App, Enzyme.
								<br>
								<br>

								<strong>Atlas-Themed Innovation:</strong>
								<br>
								&nbsp &nbsp In a creative twist, I took the initiative to theme the dashboard around Atlas's recent rebranding, moving beyond the
								project's original Holberton scope. This not only demonstrated my ability to think outside the box but also my
								commitment to aligning with the school's evolving identity.

									<strong>Duration: 2 Weeks</strong>
									<br>
									<br>
									&nbsp &nbspIn this project we have the challenge of refining the user experience for
									Spotify's desktop application. This three-part UX project is a deep
									dive into how we interact with music platforms and seeks to make those interactions
									more intuitive, enjoyable, and
									efficient.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Project Phases:</strong>
									<br>
									<br>

									<strong>Research:</strong> Kicked off with an in-depth exploration into user habits,
									preferences, and pain points. By employing a variety
									of user research methodologies, I gathered insights that would shape the foundation
									of our design strategy.
									<br>

									<strong>Prototyping:</strong> With Figma at my fingertips, I transformed research
									insights into tangible prototypes. This phase was all
									about iteration—designing, testing, and refining ideas to bridge the gap between
									user needs and Spotify's offerings.
									<br>
									<strong>Validation:</strong> The final leg of the journey involved rigorous testing
									of our prototypes. Feedback loops were crucial here,
									allowing us to validate our designs against real user expectations and experiences.
									<br>
									<br>
									<strong>Outcome and Insights:</strong>
									<br>

									&nbsp &nbsp This project was not just about redesigning; it was about rethinking how
									users connect with music on Spotify's desktop
									app. The insights gleaned have the potential to shape future updates, making the
									platform not only more user-friendly
									but also more engaging.
									<br>

									&nbsp &nbsp A comprehensive blog post detailing the journey, findings, and
									reflections from this project is available on my LinkedIn
									profile. Through this case study, I aim to share the value of thorough UX research
									and design in creating meaningful
									digital experiences.
									<br>
									<br>

									<strong>Technologies and Tools Used:</strong> Figma for prototyping, alongside a
									suite of user research methodologies to ensure our
									designs were grounded in real user needs.
